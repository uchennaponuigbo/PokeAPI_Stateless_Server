Feedback from Midterm
That being said, there is actually a lot happening in this code.  Specifically the “search”.  

The API doesn’t actually support search, so instead have the user pick a Pokemon and then you attempt 
to go through a process of getting those abilities bu never prompt the user.  
You go right back to the API and get some data.  

It is not really clear what the search goal is here.  
Are you trying to implement a "search" by pokemon and then present a list of abilities 
and then get ore details on those?

Seems like the opposite would be better, allow the user to search by ability get a list of pokemon 
that have the ability and then let the user to select to get more detail.
